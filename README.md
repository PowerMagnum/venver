# venver
Python Virtual Environment making tool

Write in py_path.txt all your python versions paths, compile venver.cpp and run venver.exe with PowerShell command "venver.exe version [virtual_env_name]"
Example "venver.exe 3.10 my_venv"
you can omit virtual environment name, it will be "venv" default
Example "venver.exe" 3.10

Obviously the numeric version depends on your py_path.txt file on first column
